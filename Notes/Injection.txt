What is React known to be React?
React, also known as React.js or ReactJS, is an open-source JavaScript library developed and maintained by Facebook. It is a popular front-end library used for building user interfaces (UIs) and managing the view layer of web applications. React was first released in 2013 and has since gained significant traction in the web development community.
Component-Based Architecture:
             React follows a component-based architecture, where UI elements are broken down into reusable and self-contained components. Each component represents a specific part of the UI, and they can be combined to build complex user interfaces.
JSX (JavaScript XML):
             React uses JSX, an extension of JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. JSX makes it easier to describe the UI components' structure and their relationships
Unidirectional Data Flow: 
            React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows in a single directionâ€”from parent components to child components. This helps maintain a clear data flow and simplifies the debugging process.
Due to its efficient rendering, modular structure, and large community support, React has become one of the most popular choices for building modern, interactive, and performant user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
